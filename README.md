# TraqNote

TraqNote is an application which will allow a user to create, store and retrieve notes based on keywords. It's main use is for allowing the ability to scan documents and make sugestions based on keywords that are found. A note is organized by category, topic and keywords. It's a way for a user to create their own "brain dump" of information which can be retieved anywhere at anytime. It will have a feature which can do a live scan on any document and make sugestions based on keywords. The idea's inception came about while having to conform to certain coding standards for programming projects. It will have a feature (not yet implemented) to scan a document taken from a picture.
